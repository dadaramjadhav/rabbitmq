🔁 2. Test Message Durability Across Node Restart
Requires durable: true queues and persistent messages

Steps:
Stop the app.

Publish a message manually (or use rabbitmqadmin/UI).

Restart a RabbitMQ node:
docker restart rabbit1
Start the app again.

✅ App should still consume the message.

✅ Confirms:
Quorum queue is durable, message survives node restart.



🧪 3. Test Failover via HAProxy
Steps:
Start app.

Kill the primary node:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker stop rabbit1
Observe app logs — message delivery should continue.

✅ Confirms:

HAProxy correctly reroutes traffic to other healthy nodes

Quorum queue continues working
